# console-game
An easy game in console with graphic made of characters
As 'x' player moves on the map by WSAD and interact with objects:
  -push boxes;
  -pick objects, points;
  -open doors;
  -etc;
1st task is to move boxes (@) to special panels.

This is a testing level with no design, just to test mechanics.
On the right there is 'panel' which do nothing at the moment but tests printing things independetly to the level map.
